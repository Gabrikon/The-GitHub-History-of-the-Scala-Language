# The GitHub History of the Scala Language

This project contains the entire development history of Scala, including information about who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. The goal of this project is to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala using data from a version control system (Git) and a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is considered a mature language. The dataset used in this project includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `datasets/`: Contains the CSV files with the project history data.
- `notebook.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to read in and analyze the project history data.
