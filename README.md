# The GitHub History of the Scala Language

This project contains the entire development history of Scala, including information about who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews[^1^][5]. The goal of this project is to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala using data from a version control system (Git) and a project hosting site (GitHub)[^1^][5]. With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is considered a mature language[^1^][5]. The dataset used in this project includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files[^1^][5].

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `datasets/`: Contains the CSV files with the project history data.
- `notebook.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to read in and analyze the project history data.
